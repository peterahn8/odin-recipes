    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Blackberry Syrup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup blackberry jam</li>
        <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbs. honey</li>
        <li>2 tbs. water</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Lemon Pancakes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, rub the lemon zest into the granulated sugar until fragrant. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, buttermilk and butter. Add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir until just combined. The batter will be a bit lumpyâ€¦make sure not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick griddle pan over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup of batter to the pan and cook a few minutes on both sides, until just lightly golden brown. Place cooked pancakes on an oven proof plate and let rest in a 200 degree oven while you fry the rest of the pancakes. Makes about 6-8 pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk all ingredients together and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let stand for 5-10 minutes. Adjust consistency as needed by adding a few teaspoons of water. Whisk again until smooth and pour over pancakes!</li>
    </ol>
